	<p><b>Enterprise has a huge opportunity to embrace and mainstream wearable technology.</b><br>

Companies are putting wearables to work in the workforce—and our data shows that people are remarkably unconcerned about the net impact wearable technology could have on their job security or autonomy.  And in an era  where workplace loyalties are fragile, wearable technology  could actually increase morale if it makes it easier for  workers  to  produce  more  efficiently  and  provide  better  service, making them stronger employees overall. Likewise, use of wearable technology in employer-sponsored health and wellness programs can lead to a healthier and thereby more productive workforce.  Implementation of wearable tech could have very clear implications for a company’s bottom line—opening the door for enterprise to subsidize the use of wearable devices amongst both employees and consumers.<br>
<br>
<b>There are many applications for wearable tech in enterprise.</b><br>
<br>
The potential benefits of wearable devices are manifold.  Among the workforce, devices can be used as training agents, speeding up the onboarding process through real- time feedback. In retail, wearable devices can upend point of sale processes, improve customer service throughout the store and speed up purchasing. In manufacturing, wearable tech can help expedite production by creating hands-free guidance tools. In service industries, wearable devices can speed access to information in real time and enable seamless action.  In medical centers, wearable devices can improve accuracy of information, streamline procedures and increase clinical trials. And through fitness devices and corresponding incentives, wearable technology can drive significant decreases in health care costs.  In all of these cases, effective implementation of wearable technology stands to benefit both the user and the company driving adoption, increasing efficiency and efficacy.<br>
<br>
<b>But for wearables to really work, they must be anchored in human-centered design.</b><br>
<br>
The practice known as “human-centered design” is one that reshapes an entire enterprise and its capabilities system around the customer or user experience. This practice is critical to the success of wearable devices—design thinking must be embedded in disruptive strategy and innovation, with a focus on optimizing the customer experience. Much of what is on the market today lacks this critical process element. The category is still in its infancy, though, and as innovation speeds along, human-centered design will emerge as a key differentiator—and a key driver of wearable success.<br>
<br>
<b>Consistency of data is also critical to success—and has important implications for Big Data.</b><br>
<br>
One of the biggest challenges confronting wearable technology today is the consistency of data. At its simplest level, the data that wearable tech provides can be very basic and a closed experience between a device and supporting app or mobile web experience.  But for wearables to be most  valuable to the user, the data from the wearables experience  will need to be integrated more broadly in an interoperable  ecosystem, rather than acting standalone.  And when this happens, Big Data is poised to get a whole lot bigger—and better. A critical inflection point for the wearable category will be its ability to account for environmental surroundings and take data in as seamlessly as it pushes data out.  Most notably, wearables cannot be divorced from the Internet of Things—whether local or remote, they must interact with other services and be used in conjunction with the cloud and corresponding Big Data applications.<br>
<br>
<b>Wearable tech will continue to revolutionize the health care industries.</b><br>
<br>
While consumers have not yet embraced healthcare wearable tech in large numbers, they are intrigued. Companies will be well-served to create affordable products that offer greater value for both users and their healthcare partners. They will also be wise to weigh the benefits of subsidizing health care wearable devices—while consumers do not want to pay much for their wearable devices, they would be compelled to use them if they were incentivized. 70% of consumers say they would wear employer-provided wearables streaming anonymous data to a pool in exchange for a break on their insurance premiums.  Moreover, employers will help mainstream wearable devices through sponsored wellness programs, and pharmaceutical and provider networks will leverage wearables to integrate with other content and services around key solutions that go beyond prescriptions and pills to drive meaningful behavior change.<br>
<br>
<b>Wearable technology will likely change advertising and content as we know it.</b><br>
<br>
While wearable technology has yet to gain widespread popularity, advertising companies are already conceiving of ways to deliver marketing messages directly to people who sport computerized watches, glasses and headgear.  After all, the thinking goes, where there’s a screen, there’s an opportunity—and if projections are correct that sales of wearables could reach over 130 million units and gross almost $6 billion by 2018, that opportunity is a big one.  Wearables allow opportunity for delivering advertising with much greater context and relevance to the user—solidifying the trend away from advertising as “interruption” and toward native advertising.  The more relevant and engaging the advertising, the more it is valued content, the less it feels like interruption.  It becomes part of a branded experience vs.  Something you put up with to get to the content.  In content marketing, brands talk about “activity based engagement” as the driver for success.  Wearables turn advertising into activity based engagement and integrate it even more closely with other content and experiences. The future of wearable advertising will mean that data is acutely targeted, optimizing the push and pull of information to create perfectly timed, astutely relevant, emotionally on- point messaging.  Moreover, while wearable tech is opening up more screens on which to showcase relevant inventory, our research indicates that the focus will be on serving content, rather than on serving ad units. Content curation and integration will be big themes for marketers as wearables become mainstream and combine with the physical experience.<br>
<br>
<b>Wearable Tech will upend retail conventions.</b><br>
<br>
Wearable tech is poised to create an enhanced customer experience—cue better, more informed service; faster checkout and payment processes; greater and more reliable access to special offers and deals; and more real-time input into purchasing decisions. Wearable devices will enable consumers to integrate the at home, on-the-go and in store experiences—versus relying on smartphones, tablets or PCs to move from couch to the shelf. This process will be made possible through passive listening elements as well as active cues—what you listen to, what you “like” and what you browse.  As a result of this information, retailers will be able to connect the dots between pre-store behavior and in-store behavior, reaching a new level of “interconnected retail.”</p>
